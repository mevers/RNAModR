# All changes to RNAModR are documented here

## Version 0.2.0

### Major

- Major changes to functions in BuildTx.R to reflect critical changes in
  `GenomicRanges_1.32.0` and `RMariaDB` that completely broke functionality
  of `BuildTx`
- Major changes to structure of `txLoc` objects; `txLoc` is now a dressed
  `list` of `DataFrame`s (instead of a dressed `list` of `data.frame`s). This
  has the advantage that we can now store arbitrary R objects in columns, such
  as `GRanges`, `DNAStringSet` etc.
- In `classes.R`: Added `show` method; this means that we can simply type the
  name of the `txLoc` object into an R terminal, hit <Enter> and get a summary.
- In `classes.R`: Removed `info` method
- In `IO.R`: Renamed `WriteTxLocToBED` to `WriteBED`; chromosome names are
  now always formatted in UCSC style (i.e. chr1, chr2, chrM, ...)
- In `IO.R`: Renamed `WriteTxLocToCSV` to `WriteCSV`
- In `IO.R`: Removed `WriteFeatToBED`
- In `IO.R`: Removed export of `ReadDBN` (which is needed by `GetMFE`, which
  in turn is also not exported)
- In `methods.R`: Removed `method = "perm"` from `GenerateNull`
- In `plot.R`: Removed `filter` argument from `PlotSectionDistribution`,
  `PlotSpatialDistribution`, `PlotSectionEnrichment`, `PlotSpatialEnrichment`;
  this is because filtering should be done through `FilterTxLoc`
- In `plot.R`: Removed `PlotTxSecLength` and `PlotTxSecLength.bean`, because
  such functions should be managed and defined on a per-use and per-user basis.

### Minor

- In `plot.R`: Tidied `PlotSectionDistribution`
- In `plot.R`: Tidied `PlotSectionEnrichment`
- Renamed "transcript sections" to "transcript regions" in all documentation

## Version 0.1.0

- Changed method to calculate nearest distances between two
  GRanges objects. We now collapse ranges to the start position
  and determine nearest distances based on start positions of the
  two GRanges objects. Thanks to Andrew Shafik for prompting this.
