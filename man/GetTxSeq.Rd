\title{Get sequences for transcript segments.}
\usage{
GetTxSeq(txBySec, skipIntrons = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{txBySec}{A \code{list} of \code{GRangesList} objects;
output of function \code{GetTxBySec} or \code{CollapseTxBySec}.}

\item{skipIntrons}{A logical scalar; if \code{TRUE} sequences
based on introns are not extracted; this is usually a good idea
as long intronic sequences can lead to large memory imprints
(and file sizes if objects are saved).}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of \code{DNAStringSet} objects.
}
\description{
Get sequences for transcript segments.
This is a low-level function that is being called from
\code{BuildTx}.
