\title{Return list of nearest distances between entries from two
\code{GRangesList} objects.}
\usage{
GetRelDistNearest(gr1, gr2)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr1}{A \code{GRangesList} object.}

\item{gr2}{A \code{GRangesList} object.}
}
\value{
A list of integer vectors. See 'Details'.

\description{
Return list of nearest distances between entries from two
\code{GRangesList} objects. See 'Details'.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{GenomicRanges::distanceToNearest}
to return the nearest distances between the start positions
of a features from \code{gr1} and any feature from \code{gr2}
with the same name (based on field \code{seqnames}). The
return object is a list of distances, where every list
element corresponds to a list element from \code{gr1} and
\code{gr2}.
Note that distances are given as signed integers: Negative
distances correspond to pos(gr1) < pos(gr2), positive
distances correspond to pos(gr1) > pos(gr2).
