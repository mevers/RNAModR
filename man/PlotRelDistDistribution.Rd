\title{Plot distribution of relative distances.}
\usage{
PlotRelDistDistribution(loc1, loc2, flank = 1000, binWidth = 20,
  doBootstrap = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc1}{A \code{txLoc} object.}

\item{loc2}{A \code{txLoc} object.}

\item{flank}{An integer scalar; specifies the absolute maximum
relative distance used as a cutoff; default is 1000.}

\item{binWidth}{An integer scalar; specifies the spatial width
by which distances will be binned; default is 20.}

\item{doBootstrap}{A logical scalar; if \code{YES} calculate
95% CI based on empirical bootstrap of relative distances within
transcript region; default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Plot distribution of relative distances between sites
from two \code{txLoc} objects. See 'Details'.
}
\details{
The function calculates the minimum distance between entries
from two \code{txLoc} objects located within the same
transcript section. Relative distances are shown within a
window (-\code{flank}, \code{flank}), where negative
distances correspond to an upstream feature from \code{loc1}
relative to \code{loc2}, and positive distances to a
downstream feature from \code{loc1} relative to \code{loc2}.
Relative distances are binned in bins of \code{binWidth} nt,
and shown as an abundance histogram.
If \code{doBootstrap = TRUE}, 95% confidence intervals are
calculated and shown, based on an empirical bootstrap of
relative distances.
